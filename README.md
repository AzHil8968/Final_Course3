The run_analysis.R code :

-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The output of run_analysis.R is saved as .txt (and .csv) file called "average_of_each_variable".

 CodeBook.md is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
